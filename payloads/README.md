# Payloads
## What is a payload?
A payload is a script that will be injected into a URL to run an XSS script.
## How do I use a payload?
See [README.md](https://github.com/keeganjk/slingshot.xss/blob/master/README.md "README.md").
## How can I write my own payloads?
Simply make any file, most file formats should work, but to be safe, use the correct file extension for what you are doing (<code>.js</code> for JavaScript, <code>.php</code> for PHP, etc.).
There is a custom folder in the folder of each language, just for you! You can put the payload anywhere, but if you like to be organized, you can use <code>custom/</code> if you want.
